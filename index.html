					Hello! I'm a human that likes to code stuff, I also like to learn stuff, more than what I already know. There are some games that I play like Albion Online and sometimes League of Legends: Wild Rift (Mobile version of League of Legends), and I used to play <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh" title="Welcome to osu!" target="_blank" class="text-danger">osu!</a> and I <span class="fst-italic" class="text-danger">was</span> pretty decent at it; I used to play 7* maps (didn't really get much passes but it wasn't horrible). About my coding career, I started learning at around the age of 9 I'd say? But it wasn't really serious and didn't understand what I'm doing. I tried to learn full-stack web development by doing HTML then CSS then JavaScript, but I did half of an <a href="https://sololearn.com" title="An online learning website for coding" target="_blank" class="text-danger">HTML course</a> online (yes, at the age of 9) and then stopped learning. I just tried to make stuff from time to time. When I really got serious with programming it was around a year-ish ago (2021-2022). Since then, I made a few projects in different languages. I know JavaScript, Python, some C#, HTML and CSS. I also develop discord bots, so hit me up if you need help or something [free of charge ;) hosting not included] I made a text-based RPG game that runs on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface" title="Learn about what's a CLI" target="_blank" class="text-danger">CLI</a> with python, and I called it "CLI Grounds", that's the only name I could've thought about (the project's repository is below). After that I tried to make a C# Framework to help in making text-based games for the CLI. I didn't make a repository for it but I called it "chaos", seemed reasonable to me because the framework was meant to be for RPG games (no repository is available for it, I don't think there will ever be one). Besides these projects, I made a couple of games. I made a few on <a href="https://roblox.com" title="A big platform for games" target="_blank" class="text-danger">roblox</a> and one did pretty well more than I expected, it reached a couple of favourites plus 170-ish worth of robux. I made a <a href="https://recleun.itch.io/simple-space-shooter" title="You can play it here!" target="_blank" class="text-danger">game</a> on <a href="https://itch.io" title="A pretty cool website for games" target="_blank" class="text-danger">itch.io</a> when I was kinda bored and found a cool game maker software called <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php" title="An engine I used to make a game" target="_blank" class="text-danger">PICO-8</a>. I made with it a simple space shooter game. Maybe you should check it out.

							Yes, it's the one you are looking at right now. I made it because its always cool to have a website. You know the sites that you can put your own site into and you never do because you don't have a website? That's a reason of many for me to make this website, and that's pretty much all of my projects worthy of putting them on here, you can check all my public repositories on <a href="https://github.com/recleun" target="_blank" class="text-danger">my github</a> just in case you want to see more.
